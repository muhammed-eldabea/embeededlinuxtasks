For example : 
    Google have onr IP but mutiple services  How it Can be Handled 
    the IP + Port Gurantee the access to the services 
    IP:40   Goole Drive 
    IP:80   Google Phhotos 
    IP:8080 File Transfer 

    So the IP + the Port = Socket 
    and use this socket we Can Access the service
